# Step 1: Open MongoDB    using mongosh
mongosh

# Step 2: Create a database for the books and publishers graph
use books_publisher_db

# Step 3: Create collections and insert data for authors, books, publishers, and readers
db.authors.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "John Smith", genre: "Comics" },
  { _id: 2, name: "Jane Doe", genre: "Fiction" },
  { _id: 3, name: "Alice Johnson", genre: "Science" }
])

db.publishers.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "Sage" },
  { _id: 2, name: "Penguin" },
  { _id: 3, name: "Nobel" }
])

db.books.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, title: "Comic Adventures", authorId: 1, publisherId: 1, genre: "Comics" },
  { _id: 2, title: "Science Explained", authorId: 3, publisherId: 2, genre: "Science" },
  { _id: 3, title: "Fictional World", authorId: 2, publisherId: 3, genre: "Fiction" }
])

db.readers.insertMany([

  { _id: 4, name: "Olivia White", bookId: 3, rating: 2, review: "Not my type" }
])

# Step 4: Write the queries to fetch the required results

# a. List the names of authors who wrote “Comics”
db.books.aggregate([
  { $match: { genre: "Comics" } },
  { $lookup: {
    from: "authors",
    localField: "authorId",
    foreignField: "_id",
    as: "author_info"
  }},
  { $unwind: "$author_info" },
  { $project: { "author_info.name": 1 } }
])

# b. Count number of readers who read a specific book published by "Sage"
db.books.aggregate([
  { $match: { publisherId: { $in: [db.publishers.findOne({ name: "Sage" })._id] } } },
  { $lookup: {
    from: "readers",
    localField: "_id",
    foreignField: "bookId",
    as: "readers_info"
  }},
  { $project: { "readers_info": 1 } },
  { $count: "totalReaders" }
])

# c. List all publishers whose name starts with “N”
db.publishers.aggregate([
  { $match: { name: { $regex: "^N", $options: "i" } } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# d. List the names of people who have given a rating of (>=3) for a specific book, for example, "Comic Adventures"
db.books.aggregate([
  { $match: { title: "Comic Adventures" } },
  { $lookup: {
    from: "readers",
    localField: "_id",
    foreignField: "bookId",
    as: "reader_info"
  }},
  { $unwind: "$reader_info" },
  { $match: { "reader_info.rating": { $gte: 3 } } },
  { $project: { "reader_info.name": 1 } }
])

# Step 5: Exit MongoDB   
exit
